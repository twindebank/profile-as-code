  bio: >
    Having graduated from the University of Oxford with a high 2.i in Engineering
    Science, I am now on the pursuit to
    advance my career in applied Machine Learning and Data Science. My current position
    has me working as part of a team
    to deliver a centralised machine learning platform for usage across the BBC's
    many divisions.

    - >
      Awarded the Gibb's prize for best third year team project. Designed hardware,
      a distributed computing facility,
      and set of computational processes that make it possible to scan, process, upload,
      and save an entire human brain
      for possible future reanimation. This fine-tuned my team working skills and
      has broadened my data analysis
      skill-set.

      Having joined BBC Datalab in its early formation, I have worked along side the
      team to develop organisation-wide
      information sharing and federation systems, using structured data, semantics,
      and machine learning.
    - >
      As an 'experimental' team, we have been working with technologies and platforms
      new to the BBC - discovering
      how best technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Istio can be employed
      on Google Cloud Platform to
      maximise the value for our audiences.
    - >
      Cross-functionality in the team has me deep diving into many areas of work,
      such as provisioning and managing our
      Kubernetes clusters using Terraform, implementing vector similarity scoring
      for our collaborative filtering
      model in Elasticsearch, developing and adding features to an API supporting
      a live app, and writing
      a library for distributed logging and tracing across our microservices.
    - >
      Beyond coding, I have talked at PyData London 2018 about technologies the team
      are working with. This proved
      an invaluable experience, which, among other things, emphasised to me the importance
      of the communities that
      surround the open source tools we use daily. In addition, I work with a colleague
      on communications for the
      team, determining how we best share knowledge to the wider BBC and our audiences.

      Working as part of a new team tackling data silos within the BBC. From scratch,
      the team are building a
      microservice-based infrastructure, designed to ingest and relate content from
      across the BBC into a single place.
    - >
      Experience, understanding, and general awareness of the many tools and platforms
      used in a context such as this
      have increased dramatically.
    - >
      Growth of knowledge beyond code is facilitated through exposure to the product
      growing from concept to reality;
      for example, how internal/external communications are handled, how roadmaps
      are developed and are dynamic, how to deal with constantly changing requirements,
      and how to make decisions in unfamiliar environments.

      Put your hands up if you haven’t heard of the BBC! None of you? Thought so…
      Not only will this talk give you an
      insight into the unique challenges and opportunities alike the BBC faces with
      data, but you will also gain an
      entry-level understanding Semantic Web technologies, and how concepts such as
      knowledge graphs can provide
      powerful ways to analyse and emphasise relationships in data.
