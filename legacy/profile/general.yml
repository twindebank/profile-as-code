  Having graduated from the University of Oxford with a high 2.i in Engineering Science, I am now on the pursuit to
  advance my career in applied Machine Learning and Data Science. My current position has me working as part of a team
  to deliver a centralised machine learning platform for usage across the BBC's many divisions.
