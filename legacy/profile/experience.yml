          Having joined BBC Datalab in its early formation, I have worked along side the team to develop organisation-wide
          information sharing and federation systems, using structured data, semantics, and machine learning.
        - >
          As an 'experimental' team, we have been working with technologies and platforms new to the BBC - discovering
          how best technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Istio can be employed on Google Cloud Platform to
          maximise the value for our audiences.
        - >
          Cross-functionality in the team has me deep diving into many areas of work, such as provisioning and managing our
          Kubernetes clusters using Terraform, implementing vector similarity scoring for our collaborative filtering
          model in Elasticsearch, developing and adding features to an API supporting a live app, and writing
          a library for distributed logging and tracing across our microservices.
        - >
          Beyond coding, I have talked at PyData London 2018 about technologies the team are working with. This proved
          an invaluable experience, which, among other things, emphasised to me the importance of the communities that
          surround the open source tools we use daily. In addition, I work with a colleague on communications for the
          team, determining how we best share knowledge to the wider BBC and our audiences.

          Working as part of a new team tackling data silos within the BBC. From scratch, the team are building a
          microservice-based infrastructure, designed to ingest and relate content from across the BBC into a single place.
        - >
          Experience, understanding, and general awareness of the many tools and platforms used in a context such as this
          have increased dramatically.
        - >
          Growth of knowledge beyond code is facilitated through exposure to the product growing from concept to reality;
          for example, how internal/external communications are handled, how roadmaps are developed and are dynamic, how to deal with constantly changing requirements, and how to make decisions in unfamiliar environments.
