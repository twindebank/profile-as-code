I have acted as the both team-wide and company-wide expert on the majority of our data platform stack, helping onboard and coach new team members, giving talks to various engineering collectives across the company, and producing high quality documentation to help folks work with and develop on our data platform. Currently ranked as 'exceeding expectations'.",

It is a policy-based distributed system built in Go that syncs permissions for 2000+ staff and 100,000+ data assets, that combines both role and attribute based access control paradigms."
