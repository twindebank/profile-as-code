      achievements:
        - >
          Awarded the Gibb's prize for best third year team project. Designed hardware, a distributed computing facility,
          and set of computational processes that make it possible to scan, process, upload, and save an entire human brain
          for possible future reanimation. This fine-tuned my team working skills and broadened my data analysis
          skill-set.
        - >
          Co-authored a paper relating to the findings of my fourth year project, `Mosquito Detection with Neural Networks:
          The Buzz of Deep Learning'.
