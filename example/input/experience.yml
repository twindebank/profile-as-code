          In my first three months, I helped roll out dbt (data build tool) across the company. I designed and built
          supporting infrastructure and wrote the onboarding docs introducing the new ways of working, which have been
          highly praised and used by over 100 people at Monzo. As a result of my technical and communications work,
          I was identified as a high performer and promoted at the end of my probation period.
        - >
          Code I have written helps tens of people develop on and deploy the same data models daily, with the reliability
          increasing thanks to rigorous CI/CD checks as well as a strong embedded data testing culture that I have helped
          cultivate.
        - >
          As tech lead, I designed and led the development of a system to control access to sensitive user data.
          The distributed system, written in Go, is able to automatically approve or deny access requests,
          and allows people to securely access to the data they need within minutes.

          At Monzo, I've broken my fair share of things. In doing so, I have immediately assigned myself as the incident lead
          and taken ownership in finding a resolution; co-ordinating others and communicating to the wider company until
          the incident is resolved.
        - >
          Working at Monzo has given me an understanding of how to develop software and platforms in a way that can support
          rapidly growing data teams and volume of data, enabling people to perform at exceptional levels.

          Having joined BBC Datalab in its early formation, I worked with the team to develop organisation-wide
          information sharing and federation systems, using structured data, semantics, and machine learning.
        - >
          As an experimental team, we worked with technologies and platforms new to the BBC - discovering
          how best technologies and platforms such as Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and Docker, could maximise value
          for the audiences.
        - >
          Cross-functionality in the team had me deep diving into many areas, such as provisioning and managing our
          Kubernetes clusters using Terraform, implementing vector similarity scoring for our collaborative filtering
          model in Elasticsearch, developing and adding features to an API supporting a live app, and writing
          a library for distributed logging and tracing across our microservices.
        - >
          I talked at PyData London 2018 about technologies the team worked with. This proved
          an invaluable experience, which, among other things, emphasised the importance of the communities that
          surround the open source tools we use daily. In addition, I worked on communications for the
          team, determining how we best disseminate knowledge to the wider BBC.

          Quantitative Finance, working on a project to detect mosquito presence, species, and gender from audio
          recordings.
        - >
          Developed a fully-featured python package to act as a test-bed for detection algorithms, aimed for a public
          open source release. This has improved my skills in coding for a long-term project where the code will be
